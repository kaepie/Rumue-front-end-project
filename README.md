## Features

   Users can quickly check prices for insurance or CMI. To get a quote:
   - Select the desired type of insurance (e.g., Comprehensive, Third-party Liability, etc.).
   - Enter vehicle details such as brand, model, year, and mileage.
   - The system calculates and displays a tailored price based on the selected type and the car’s condition, providing users with quick and accurate price estimates.

2. **Purchase Insurance or CMI**  
   After checking the price, users can proceed to purchase:
   - Enter any additional vehicle information as required.
   - Complete the purchase by making a payment through the application.

3. **Request Tracking**  
   Users can track the status of their insurance or CMI requests:
   - **Pending**: The request is pending verification by a staff member.
   - **Completed**: Staff has verified the information and completed the process.
   - **Rejected**: Information verification failed, and the request was rejected.

4. **Expiration Notifications**  
   For returning users who have previously purchased insurance or CMI through this platform:
   - The system sends a reminder email when their policy is close to expiration, ensuring they never miss a renewal.

5. **Receipt Generation**  
   Once an insurance or CMI renewal request is confirmed:
   - The system generates a receipt and emails it to the customer.
